Ethan - AP Calculus BC:
This is a college-level introductory calculus course designed to cover all the topics in
Advanced Placement Calculus AB (see above) as well as Parametric Equations and
Polar Coordinates (motion in the plane, speed and velocity, tangent lines, area, and
arc length) and Sequences and Series (recursive sequences, convergence of
sequences, geometric series, convergence of series, convergence tests, power series,
Taylor polynomials, Taylor series, and Lagrangeâ€™s error bound). The goal of this course
is to introduce students to the fundamental ideas of single-variable calculus while
preparing them for success on the AP Calculus BC Exam. An emphasis will be placed
on conceptual understanding, cultivating problem solving skills, implementing
technology, and developing mathematical intuition. Applications to geometry,
science, economics, and numerical methods will be included.
